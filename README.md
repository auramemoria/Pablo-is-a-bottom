Story Script Opening

-Darkrai, a malicious mythical pokemon known for consuming through people and pokemon's nightmares, roams through the night when the moon don't shine. His greed only grows by the night causing the dream incident. Friends, family and Pokémon fear grew as they hide at night holding onto the moon feather to keep away from Darkrai's greed

"This town is emptier than what I remembered...."

Darkrai heads from home to home, finding nothing more but emptiness. People are at a community center helping each other at night to protect themselves and the current victims in their beds breathing heavily and struggling in their nightmares.

"I guess it leaves me no choice... ill get something stronger... its about time"

*Darkrai takes out a Griseous Orb until somone approached behind him*

"I think you've had enough Darkrai, I can no long turn a blind eye as you harm more humans and pokemon" -Cresselia

"I think you've got it wrong... you simply could not catch up to me" -Darkrai

"You need to stop this, I understand your need to feed yourself but look at what you caused. Do you have no self restraint?!" -Cresselia

"No, I really do not. Don't you see how much powerful i've become? I'll finally become Legendary... with this" *Darkrai shows Cresselia the Griseous Orb*

"You're playing with fire, if I were you I wouldn't. Giratina is not one to mess with. You could cause something worst than death-" -Cresselia

*The orb starts the shine, opening a portal*

"Darkrai, No!!"

*Cresselia quickly holds onto Darkrai obsorbing onto the portal*

"Dammit! Cresselia! Not you!" -Darkrai

*Both Cresselia and Darkrai warp into the portal, they appear into the distortion world where Giratina lives*

"Ugh.... im finally here... ha ha.... -" -Darkrai

*A large ominous pokemon appear, Giratina the legendary pokemon appears before them*
"Who dares to come before me?!" -Giratina, cries a loud roar

"Hah, count your days. I've been dying to see you again..." -Darkrai uses dark void on Giratina to make him fall asleep and absorb through his nightmare. Giratine roars loud in anger as he falls asleep going through nightmare

"Its just too easy... I cant believe youre a legendary!" -Darkrai laughs in achievement as Cresselia stands up

"Im not letting you get away from this! Its time to put an end to this! You will not hurt Giratina or anyone else" -Cresselia takes out the lunar feather, sparkling 

"Don't think your stupid feather can stop me, ive had enough of you. I'l get rid of you and absorb you too!" -Darkrai uses dark void on cresselia making her almost fall asleep and hallucinate from nightmares but pushes on to stay aware, her energy being absorb"

"I wont... go... down!" -Cresselia uses psychic wrapping the lunar feather around his neck, making darkrai drop the griseous orb and opening the portal again absorbing

"What have you done?! I cant access the energy I absorbed?!" -Darkrai

"If I go down... you go down with me!" 

*Darkrai, Cresselia and Giratina get absorbed at the portal, the portal spaws outside in the sky dropping us in different locations in the Solara Region. Darkrai in on the ground at night. A professor studying pokemon's at night notice the commotion and finds Darkrai*

"Oh my- a Darkrai?!" -The professor notices Darkrai transform into human form unconscious

"What just happened?! A pokemon transforming into human?! He looks terribly injured, I should get him treated first" -The professor takes the darkrai to his lab and into his room. After some time Darkrai wakes up.

"Ugh... where am I...?" -Darkrai says in pain, his head swirling 

"You're awake, I found you unconscious and too you to my lab-"

"What do you want, human?! Do not talk to me! Ill absorb you and leave" -Darkrai tries using dark void to make him fall asleep and absorb his energy, but it fails from the Lunar feather in my neck.

"W-what is this?" "Why cant I take it off?!"
-Darkrai aggressively tries to take the necklace off but its stuck on his neck

"Relax there buddy, I tried taking your necklace off while you were sleeping so you could be more comfortable but it appears to have a magic to be unable to remove" -The professor explains

"Huh.... what am I supposed to do? I need to feed from nightmares... and now I cant... and I dont have powers... damn you cresselia!!" -Darkrai gets mad and annoyed

"If you'd like you can stay here for a while, if you cant use your powers youll be unable to survive out there by yourself" -The professor reassures trying to be nice

"Living with a human?! How degrading... ill stay for now I guess... and figure things out... I suppose" -Darkrai responds in a bad mood. 

"In that case i'll show you around and introduce you to everyone, come with me" -professor

-Song intro and Game logo as professor and darkrai walk going around the city

-change scene
*Darkrai sit at the couch watching tv while snacking, everyone around the Solara Region seems to be talking about the new pokemon champion*

"Humans and their celebrities... all they do is pokemon fight... I could easily beat them-
-Darkrai spits out his drink as he sees Giratina on tv and in human form

"How does it feel being the new pokemon champion in Solara Region" -the interviewer asks

"It's an honor to he Solara's new champion... I won't disappoint..." -Giratina answers, perhaps a little scary for people

"So it wasnt only me- while youre famous im here unable to sleep from not eating peoples dreams... why am I slacking I really need to get going" *Darkrai quickly rushes out seeing the professor who is at the lab

"Hey nerd, I need to get going. Im going to challenge the pokemon champion!" -Darkrai says straighfoward

"H-huh? I didnt take you to be that kind of person-" -The Professor is taken back by the sudden change in darkrai.

"I'm letting you know because I am really heading out! Goodbye!" -Darkrai walks away but gets stopped

"You cant leave, you have no powers. And theres many dangerous pokemons outside. How about this? I have three pokemons on the desk, choose one to start your journey"

"A pokemon having a pokemon...? Sigh... I guess I have no choice. I'll swallow my pride and choose one"

-Starter Pokemons

Rowlet, Chimchar, Froakie

*After choosing Professor grandson comes to get a pokemon as promised*

"Hey grandad! Where are the three pokemon starters as you promised?!"
 *The grandson looks at darkrai*

"Whats that weird guy you picked up doing here? No way, you gave him one of the pokemons I was choosing?!" -Granddaughtee gets angry

"Hah?! Weird guy?!" Darkrai gets mad

"Uhh... granddaughter... theres 2 left... you can choose one of either those-" The professor sounds kinda scared trying to calm the situation

"I have no choice do i? Ill just pick one stronger than his!"

*Granddaughter has a pokemon fight with Darkrai*

"Lets see who is the best!"

Granddaughter gets defeated
"Ill win next time, so dont look down on me"

Granddaughter wins
"I knew I would win, I went easy on you"

"Well now that its settled I'll hand you both a map and pokedex for your journey to guide you and win the league. Don't forget about me"

"Youre forgettable granddad, im out bye!" -The granddaughter dashes off

"I'll come back when I beat giratina..." -Drakrai  says leaving

"My name is ________, I am heading to Cinnabell City to challenge the gym leader. Why do you say to be intrigued by me? Aren't you a peculiar one to play in a dangerous zone of pokemon here in a forest?" -Darkrai

"This forest has a relaxing atmosphere to it, it calms your soul and mind... and yet its being disturbed by someone..." *Sir Nouvel looks at Darkrai in a suspicious manner but rubs it off*

"What do you mean by that? Are you insinuating-" -Darkrai gets cut off

"Don't worry about it, Trainer. This chat was very productive. I'd love to battle you someday. I'll take my leave" -Sir Nouvel walks away
